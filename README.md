# Kickstarter-analysis. Analyze kickstarter data to uncover trends

# kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This kickstarter project enables me to use my data analysis and visualization skills to provide my client (Louise) with answers that will help her make tactical decisions. Louise's latest play did not meet its fundraising goal; she now wants to compare various campaigns and obtain more insight on the correlation between their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### I analyzed the campaigns' varying outcomes based on their respective launch dates by extracting the necessary data (years) using Excel's YEAR() function in a new column, and finally creating a line chart (Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date) to visualize the information. The chart clearly displayed the number of theatre campaigns which were successful, those which failed, and those which were canceled, as well as the months the campaigns were started.

### As far as the outcomes of the campaigns of plays based on their goals, I created a line chart illustration of essential data such as the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on their funding goal amounts. In order to construct an informative chart, I had to first create a new sheet and mine the aforementioned data using Excel's COUNTIFS() function. This enable me to produce a clear and self-explanatory chart.

### The challenge I encountered while working on this project is that I originally attempted to upload and commit an Excel file which was much too large. The file was large because I had included many pages of practice which I believed would show that I took this matter seriously. In retrospect, I will only submit the work which is requested of me.

## Results
- Two conclusions which can be drawn about the outcomes based on launch dates is that:
  1. May and June are ideal months to launch successful theatre campaigns.
  2. December is not an ideal month to launch successful theatre campaigns
- Regarding the outcomes based on goals, it can be concluded that campaigns with funding goals of $4,999 and less have a much higher chance of being successful.
- I find one of the limitations of this data set to be that it does not paint a full picture of the reasons for the successes or failures of the campaigns. There is no marketing data, leaving us only to make conclusions based on limited categories such as genre, countries, and goals (to name a few).
- Possible tables and/or graphs to be created would include data comparing the success rates of the campaigns per category. This could lead to in-depth analysis of what countries the categories are more successful in.
