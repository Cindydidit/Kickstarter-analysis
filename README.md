# kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### This kickstarter project enables me to use my data anylysis and visualization skills to provide my client (Louise) with answers that will help her make tactical decisions. Louise's latest play did not meet its fundraising goal; she now wants to compare various compaigns and obtain more insight on the correlation between their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### I analized the campaigns varying outcomes based on their respective laungh dates by extracting the necessary data (years) using Excel's YEAR() function in a new column, and finally creating a line chart (Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date) to visualize the imformation. The chart clearly displayed the number of theatre campaigns which were successful, those which failed, and those which were canceled, as well as the months the compaigns were started.

### As far as the outcomes of the campaigns of plays based on their goals, I created a line chart illustration of essential data such as the percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on their funding goal amounts. In order to construct an informative chart, I had to first create a new sheet and mine the aforementioned data using Excel's COUNTIFS() function. This enable me to produce a clear and self-explainatory chart.

### The challenge I encounterred while working on this project was double checking my work so much that some time was wasted.

## Results

- Two conclusions which can be drawn about the outcomes based on launch dates is that: 1. May and June are ideal months to launch a theatre campaign.
